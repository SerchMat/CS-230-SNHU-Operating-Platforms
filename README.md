# TheGammingRoom
- Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gamming Room reach my company Creative Technology Solutions to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game, Draw It or Lose It!.
- What did you do particularly well in developing this document?
The comparison between the OS highlighting theeir pros and cons was a remarkable job by me and the team.
- What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The documentation helped to have a clear vision of what The Gamming Room company was seeking on their project. They offer information for future updates or possible changes to the game.
- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The improvement will always be good for any part of the project, but if we need to focus on one area, the comparison of the OS I will spend more time. The comparison was the strogest point that I acquire but the information and the relevant points are big so more time will lead to better decisions.
- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
One of the most important points to review are the customer experience when interacting with the product. Based on the customer experience and analysis we can predict what the user will like to see in the game. If we do not consider the users, the whole game would be useless since nobody would like to play it.
- How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
First, analyze the customer requirements and what they are seeking. Second, before start coding flowchart or pseudocoude to have a better idea of the project. Third, analyze our flowchart or pseudocode to find any possible problem. Then, it's time to code. Fix any bug and deliver.
